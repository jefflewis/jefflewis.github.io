Everyone needs a place to start, and this is mine. My goal here will be to, in some way, document the things I learn. I tend to process what I learn when I write it down, so this is where I'll do just that. With effort, this may be exactly what I need to help kick me into gear and actually commit to developing the ideas in my head.

And with that, I'm off to go listen to some advice I was given and learn me some reference counting by way of creating/destroying objects and seeing their lifecycle in Instruments.

title: Remember the basics

I spent about thirty minutes this morning trying to think of a way to server up an angular app that hadn't been set up to be served with a tool like grunt. 

After thinking for a few minutes after not finding help on Google, I had the idea to just `cd` into the app directory and start a simple python server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. The simple solutions are sometimes the best. 

I tend to over complicate and misunderstand problems by not thinking things through before I try to solve them. It's always a good reminder for me to slow down and think before I act.

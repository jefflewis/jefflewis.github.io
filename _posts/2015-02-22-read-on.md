Well,  reading [a bit about reference counting](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/MemoryMgmt.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000011-SW1) really got me pretty excited to learn more. *But* instead of continuing the Xcode project that I started for exploring reference counting, I instead decided to pick up a copy of [this book](http://smile.amazon.com/dp/0321774086/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_1968491462?_encoding=UTF8&tag=stackoverfl08-20&pf_rd_p=1968491462&pf_rd_s=smile-campaign&pf_rd_t=201&pf_rd_i=0321774086&pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_r=0QB47DBFEF8B6JW9F5DT) and work my way through it. 

What could be better, right?

My name is Jeff. I'm always trying to learn. I decided that one thing I could do to help me along that path is to start writing about the things I learn. 

I love software. I think it's amazing what it can do and I love figuring out how it works. I got started professionally as a mechanical engineer but really didn't have a heart for it. A good friend of mine convinced me that I should try to learn software development, so I gave it a shot. About a year after that, I got my first job as a software engineer. To me, the best part of the job is getting to solve new problems. Every day brings a new challenge and I *love* to figure them out. :)
